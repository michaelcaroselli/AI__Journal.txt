Week !
This week I used AI to help me with my homework exercise.
I needed to understand how to fix a line of code that was not working, after I had tried multiple times to fix it.
I was able to fix it by the help of ChatGPT because it told me that when using f string I was not using the quotations in the right way.
After doing that, I now understand how to correctly use quotations when coding f strings.

Week 2
This week I used AI to help me with my project charter and my Homework exercise.
For the homework exercirse, I was unsure about using the strip function for one of the questions and was struggling to get it to work.
I asked ChatGPT how to use the strip function and it helps me understand it better.
I also used AI to help come up with ideas for the group project during discussion.
It helps us get a better understanding of good ideas so we could create one on our own.

Week 3
This week I needed to AI to help with the week 3 Homework exercise.
It helped me in order to format different things and allowed me to use the functions correctly.
There were multiple instances when the functions were not working as I wanted and I asked ChatGPT to help fix my code.
Doing this helped me better understand how to do the things I wanted.
