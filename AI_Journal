This week I used AI to help me with my homework exercise.
I needed to understand how to fix a line of code that was not working, after I had tried multiple times to fix it.
I was able to fix it by the help of ChatGPT because it told me that when using f string I was not using the quotations in the right way.
After doing that, I now understand how to correctly use quotations when coding f strings.
